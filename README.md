# Thinking Machines Data Engineering Exam

## Part 1: Algorithmic thinking

![Additional problem](https://i.imgur.com/EdUiEtk.png)

Please code up a brute-force solution to this problem (it will not finish in a reasonable time) and at least 3 improvements to reduce the run time, ideally measuring the incremental reduction in run-time of each improvement. Some ideas:
- A data structure (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)
- Ways to reduce the values of potential parameters for `a` and `b` that you need to evaluate for (there are at least 2 simple, useful reductions)
- Parallelization

Your end solution should be able to finish in approx. 1 minute.
